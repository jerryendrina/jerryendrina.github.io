title: Data Scientist Vs Statistician in Retrospect
---

  Data scientist profession is fairly new that’s why various differing views and opinions of its definition emerge. Some say data scientists are those who are “better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” Others say that data scientists are those “responsible for translating a business problem to figure out what product to be sold to customers if they’ve already bought a product.” Both definitions make sense to me depending on what field a data scientist plays his/her role. Ultimately, I think being a data scientist is about having the ability to do statistical analysis and programming and having strong knowledge of the domain where the data scientist is applying his or her self.

Specifically, a data scientist should be able to do the following major duties and/or knowledge areas:
1. Work with different programming languages such as Python, R and SQL
2. Strong mathematical and analytical skills
3. Knowledge of statistical and data mining techniques
4. Research and develop statistical models for analysis
5. Collaborate with others to better understand needs and devise solutions
6. Communicate results and statistical concepts

  Notice that some data scientist roles I mentioned above overlap with what statisticians normally do. This is because to be a good data scientist requires a strong background on statistics. But I think there is still a clear fine line that draws the differences between data scientists and statisticians, an example is the way their data is collected. Data scientists often collect massive amounts of data which consequently makes them spend ample time with large-scale data reading, cleaning and transforming. Conversely, statisticians rely mostly on traditional methods of data collection which includes polls, questionnaires and experiments. Note though that the purpose of both data scientists and statisticians is similar, that is gathering information and making sense out of it. This is just one of the similarities and differences between the two. Others can be seen in the modeling processes, types of problems studied, academic background of the teams in the field and terminology used to name a few. 

  In relation to the similarities and differences, I view myself as someone flexible enough to handle roles of a data scientist or statistician. I believe that my masters program at NC State has prepared me well to be able to take whatever challenge is thrown at me regardless of whether it is a data scientist or statistician role. I have faith that the rigorous training and courses I have experienced in all my classes have given me confidence to be successful in both careers.
